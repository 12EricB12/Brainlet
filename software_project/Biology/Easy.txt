This term is used to describe the movement of water from an area of high concentration to low concentration. #Osmosis, Diffusion, Evaporation, Exocytosis
This type of factor refers to non-living conditions that may influence where plants or animals live. An example is temperature or the amount of sunlight. #Abiotic, Biotic, Symbiosis, Mutualism
This cell is single-celled and lacks a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They can be evolutionary lineages and are simple in structure. #Prokaryotes, Eukaryotes, Ribosomes, Stem
Photosynthesis is essential for plant survival. What is the name of the green pigment that absorbs sunlight which helps make glucose? #Chlorophyll, Chloroplast, Centrioles, Leaf
This organelle is considered the powerhouse of the cell as it generates the energy needed to power cellular functions. It is sometimes referred to as the “brain”. #Mitochondria, Ribosomes, Nucleus, Lysosomes
These organisms are extremely small and unicellular and they can only be seen under a microsome. Surprisingly, they make up 60% of Earth’s living matter. #Microbes, Macromolecules, Oxygen, Xylem
This specific process is when two new daughter cells are created from a single parent cell. The parent cell donates identical copies of chromosomes, allowing for cell replacement. #Mitosis, Meiosis, Photosynthesis, Reproduction
