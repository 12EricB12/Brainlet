This ionic functional group behaves like an acid by dissociating to produce H+ ions and becoming negatively charged. Some examples are nucleotides and nucleic acids. #Phosphate, Sulfhydryl, Amino, Carboxyl
Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls. In fact, it is not a common source of plant-based simple sugars. Name the type of glucose it contains. #Beta-glucose, Alpha-glucose, Gamma-glucose, Glycosidic
This stage of aerobic cellular respiration is an example of substrate-level phosphorylation. It consists of ten sequential enzyme-catalyzed reactions. #Glycolysis, Pyruvate Oxidation, Krebâ€™s Cycle, Electron Transport
Chlorophylls are major photosynthetic pigments in plants, and green algae. The most dominant types are chlorophyll a and b. Name the second major group of pigment molecules. #Carotenoids, Anthocyanins, Betalains, Chloroplasts
This notable individual used a light microscope and a glass prism to determine which light wavelengths were most effective for photosynthesis by using Spirogyra. #Engelmen, Watson, Endelmen, Ingenhousz
Bacterial DNA is different from eukaryotic DNA. In bacteria, plasmids contain DNA and they can exit one cell and enter another. Name this process. #Conjugation, Supercoiling, Senescence, Aminoacylation
These collections of small ribonucleoproteins bind to introns and signal them for removal, which occurs in a spliceosome. #snRNPs, SNPs, splices, inducer
