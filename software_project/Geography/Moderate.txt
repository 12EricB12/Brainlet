In a hurricane, the lowest surface pressures can be found in this area. It measures between 20-50 km in diameter, and it is the point where the rest of the storm rotates. On land, it is seen as the calmest part of the storm with clear clouds and sun. #Eye, Rainbands, Eyewall, Outflow
This scale is used to measure earthquake intensity by determining the amount of energy released. It is logarithmic and each point illustrates a tenfold increase in magnitude. #Richter, Mercalli, Fujita-Pearson, Saffir-Simpson
Magma is composed of various elements. Which of the following is not present in magma? #Beryllium, Aluminum, Sodium, Oxygen
When volcanoes erupt, they tend to eject small rock fragments into the atmosphere. Often, these pieces are large, which can destroy communication lines and bury roads. What are the ejected rock fragments called? #Tephra, Felsic, Ash, Magma
This atmospheric layer contains 75% of the atmosphereâ€™s mass. Due to the force of gravity, it has the greatest air pressure and all weather occurs in this layer. #Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Exosphere
The formation of a tornado is reliant on several factors, including strong convection currents. The main area is formed by the presence of convection currents which fills the sky with moisture and energy. As heat rises and cools in the air, clouds are formed. What is being formed? #Funnel, Eyewall, Magma, Epicenter
Several months after a volcanic eruption, heavy rains and melting snow mix with volcanic ash and rocks. This creates massive mudflows that can travel 80km. What are these mudflows called? #Lahars, Lava, Batholiths, Magma
